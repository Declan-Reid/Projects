# Spoofed JSS
Use a DNS to redirect a jamf server url to a spoofed server, to ultimately run any code needed.

## Currently working
Custom DNS server to redirect requests to local server.

## Not Currently Working
Making the local https server trusted, which means that the Jamf client won't connect (which means we can't run code).

> [!NOTE]
> My current problem is getting a trusted https server, though I suppose I could use a github pages site on a sub-domain.

# Train system GUI
An app that allows you to control LEGO trains and track switches, ensuring that no two trains ever collide, nor do any trains fall off the end of a track. This should have an editor which saves the track layout, the train layout, position, and bluetooth id, and the switch ids to a file. This should then also use a map view to show where trains are and which switches are toggled, and a panel to control train speed, colour, and other features accessible from their control block (eg. lights).
